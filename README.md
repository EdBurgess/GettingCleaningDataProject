# GettingCleaningDataProject

unzip the data for the class project

Place the run_analysis.R script into the unzipped directory("UCI HAR Dataset")

Source the script in R Studio.

This script does make use of the dplyr package, which must be installed first

After the script is sourced, a data frame called MTStep5a is produced, which contains one line for
each Subject/Activity combination from the dataset.  Each of the other columns provides the
mean value for the measurement for that particular Subject/Activity
